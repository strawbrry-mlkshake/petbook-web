This is going to read kind of like a diary. I need to make some portfolio projects. I am starting here.

'petbook', remember that? Your senior project. Let's build it again.
Remember how you built it? Ya, I copied a tutorial and changed a few things.
In the tutorial the website was branded like LinkedIn. I decided to rebrand.
I pivoted basically from a blog site geared towards promoting corporate culture to develop to a site where people would make a social media account for their pet.

The site included user accounts (your pet would have an account that you make),
user posts, user comments + likes on posts. Each user (you playing your pet) had a bio and could add their other social links.

It reminds me of the New Yorker comic that depicts a dog using a computer and the caption bubble says "on the internet, nobody knows you're a dog". Our solution to the not knowing the dogs of the internet problem would be 'petbook'.

My first interation was completed for my school project and I launched the site. No one used it. I didn't expect people to use it. I was just glad to be finished with school - I was starting to hate it there. I DELETED all of 'petbook'. v1 is vanished bits now. I do this. I DELETE everything I make. It
feels like a purifying ritual when I do it; sometimes it feels like self
harm. I am trying to stop. I don't want to burn down everything I build up.

So, I need to learn again. And, build something new.

next.js is popular and I have never used it. I would like to learn it and the benefits of SSR (server side rendering) are obvious.

I will use Tailwind too. I think it could help prevent rabbit hole dives into CSS. I am not a CSS expert. I have been working with it for 6 years daily and somehow I still feel like I need help all too often.

I am going to use Prisma to interface with the database. This technology will be new to me too. Like Tailwind, I think it will help speed up development.

I will probably use Postgresql. I may look a little bit into SQLite first. Something that works well with Prisma would be great.

I will host everything with Vercel's services. This is new to me too. I have used Mircosoft Azure cloud products in the past. I am hoping for an experience that is much less enterprise-y.

I will probly use things tools like Docker, RapidAPI (paw), Blisk, etc...
